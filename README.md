# 100DaysOfCloud Ideas List

The purpose of this repo is to provide a list of micro-projects to help people with their #100DaysOfCloud Challenge.

* If you want to take the challenge go to: https://100daysofcloud.com
* The #100DaysOfCloud Challenge Template is here: https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloud

## Contributing to this project list:

You can propose a cloud project by opening a [ticket 🎟️](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=cloud-project-idea.md&title=)

## Which Cloud Service Providers?

Projects covered could be for:
* Microsoft Azure
* Amazon Web Services
* Google Cloud Platform

We aren't limited to the big three, but thats where you'll see the most examples since IaaS have the most cloud offerings.
We may be weary of third-party cloud services since the goal of these projects is to learn a concept first and a product last.

## What is the difficult and time commitment for these projects?

Projects are labeled based these four levels:

- Level 100 (Introductory)
- Level 200 (Intermediate)
- Level 300 (Advanced)
- Level 400 (Expert)

The goal is to provide micro-projects that can be completed in minutes to hours and worst case a day.
The difficulty generally indciates greater time commitment. 
For more difficult projects more instruction can be provided to reduce the time commitment.
Projects may suggest the time it takse to complete the project
